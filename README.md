# ML-JS
Machine learning in javascript without any external machine learning library just maths.

## Examples
- XOR (Trained using backpropogration)
- Flappy bird (Trained using neuro evolution)

### NOTE
- The prediction might be wrong because of incorrect weights and biases.
- Weights and biases can be fixed by trainning more.
- Accuracy of the model can be increased be increasing number of hidden layers and the neurons in them.
- Higher number of layers and neuron need more training to reach correct weights and biases.
